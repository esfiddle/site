## Emoji Guide

We believe that emojis are fun and can be very helpful in quickly understanding changes and messages. We usually prepend emojis onto commit messages and PR messages. We try to follow a standard and here are the most common emojis and how they're used. **If you don't want to use emjois in your messages, that's just fine.**
