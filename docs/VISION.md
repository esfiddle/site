# Vision

Our vision for [ESFiddle](https://esfiddle.net) is to provide a test bench for the newest ECMAScript features. We want to encourage usage of these features by a rich library of example code. Our focus centers around the education and experimentation of new ECMAScript features that people can share with their friends.

## Future Ideas

- Create a more social front end where users can create and save fiddles. Then have featured and starred fiddles on the front page as well as a search page.
- Have a blog that is a currated list of other people's blog featuring the latest and greatest in JS.
- An API to drop small fiddles into any web page to demo features.
